		<h2>PSG's Squad</h2>
		<p>PSG's squad is worth almost one billion euros. In total, PSG have 33 first team players on the books as Ligue 1. With an estimated market value totalling 998.95 million euros. Fuelled by their Qatari ownership, the club have been able to compete with the likes of Manchester City in spending astronomical sums of money on some of the best players in Europe for nearly a decade, but their current squad now resembles a French reincarnation of the Real Madrid Galactico era. Mauricio Pochettino’s side have landed multiple key signings this summer, with the additions of three high-profile free transfers in Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma from AC Milan, Sergio Ramos from Real Madrid,Georginio Wijnaldum from Liverpool and the best player in the world Leo Messi From FC Barcalona.</p>

		<h2>PSG coach Mauricio Pochettino </h2>
		<p>Argentinian coach Mauricio Pochettino is the current manager.The aim is to make a top team from all these top players. It's an immense challenge that we are taking on with enthusiasm. We're going to have to work out how to all work together to create a dynamic in which each can find his role. If we don't play together and don't work hard enough, it'll be difficult to play as we want to. We'll have to have the constant feeling that we are a demanding and united team," said Pochettino in Friday's pre-match press conference.Pochettino  wants to have the best players, just like the other coaches. We have a very well balanced squad. Messi's arrival produced something that everyone can feel. We know that Messi is the best player in the world or one of the best. </p>
